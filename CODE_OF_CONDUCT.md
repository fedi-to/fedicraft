# Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is intended to address behaviour both inside and outside
of Fedi-To spaces, except where noted otherwise. This is because social conduct
outside of Fedi-To spaces can still have effects inside of Fedi-To spaces, and
it would be a disservice to the community to not acknowledge that.

- It is not acceptable to sexualize folks without explicit, enthusiastic
    consent.
- It is not acceptable to publicly sexualize folks in community spaces.
- It is not acceptable to promote or support, directly and/or indirectly,
    surveillance and/or related technologies, including ML/AI, facial
    recognition, tracking cookies, fingerprinting, profiling, among others,
    regardless of consent.
